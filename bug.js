I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I inspected the generated CSS, and it appeared that some of my classes were missing or were being overridden by other styles. This only happened in production mode, while development mode worked fine. I tried purging unused styles but that didn't help.  The problem only seemed to manifest in specific components, not globally.
